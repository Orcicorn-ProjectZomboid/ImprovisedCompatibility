title=Improvised Compatibility
description=A collection of compatibility patches to make my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2797187720]Home Improvisation mods[/url] work with other popular or requested mods.

description=As the collection grows be sure to only enable the mod ID that matches the set of mods you wish to add compatibility for.  They should be enabled AFTER the parent mods are loaded. So for example if you are adding compatibility between Improvised Glass and ModA, make sure to enable Glass and ModA BEFORE the compatibility mod.
